# Temperature-Analysis-Project
This project utilizes a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily) dataset. The dataset contains daily temperature records from various land surface stations across the globe. The primary goal of this project is to analyze temperature variations over time and visualize the findings effectively. 

The following datasets are used in this project:
1. Temperature.csv: Contains daily temperature records with columns for station ID, date, element type (TMAX/TMIN), and temperature values (in tenths of degrees Celsius).
2. BinSize.csv: Contains metadata about weather stations, including their geographic coordinates.
